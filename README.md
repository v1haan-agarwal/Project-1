## 🧠 What It Does

This device's cutting mechanism utilizes a four-bar linkage to create the desired motion for cutting. The four-bar linkage works in parallel with a feeder mechanicism that is also controlled from the same starting input movement, but is slightly staggered and slower. This allow for the cutting mechanicism to move faster than the feeder mechanism to allow for ample time to cut efficiently.
